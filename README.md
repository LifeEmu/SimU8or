# SimU8or

A frontend framework for [SimU8](https://github.com/LifeEmu/SimU8), a portable U8 emulator written in C.

This frontend mainly focuses on emulating CASIO fx-ES (PLUS)/CWI/CWII calculators.


## Features

- **Minimum dependency.** It relies on nearly nothing. If you're willing to do so, you could run it on bare metal embedded platforms.
- **Maximum control.** You are the one to decide what to implement and what not to. In other words, you're responsible to implement everything.


## Examples

- Terminal/Console
- GTK/Win32 GUI
- SDL
- Nuklear/Dear ImGui
- bitmap frame buffer (on embedded devices)
